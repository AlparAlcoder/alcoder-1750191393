# FastAPI Items API

The FastAPI Items API is a simple API built using FastAPI and Pydantic. It provides endpoints for creating and retrieving items. The items are stored in-memory and are not persistent.

## Dependencies

- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- Pydantic: A data validation library that uses Python type annotations to validate data and convert (deserialize) input data to Python objects.

## Models

### Item

The `Item` model represents an item with the following attributes:

- `name`: The name of the item. It's a required string.
- `description`: The description of the item. It's a required string.
- `price`: The price of the item. It's a required float.

## Endpoints

### `GET /items/{item_id}`

This endpoint retrieves an item by its ID.

#### Parameters

- `item_id`: The ID of the item. It's a required integer.

#### Responses

- `200 OK`: The item is found and returned.
- `404 Not Found`: The item is not found.

### `POST /items/`

This endpoint creates a new item.

#### Request Body

- `item`: The item to create. It should be a `Item` object.

#### Responses

- `200 OK`: The item is successfully created and returned.

## Examples

### Retrieve an item

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/items/1')
print(response.json())
```

### Create an item

```python
import requests

item = {
    "name": "Sample Item",
    "description": "This is a sample item.",
    "price": 19.99
}

response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/items/', json=item)
print(response.json())
```

## Notes

- As the items are stored in-memory, they will be lost when the server is restarted.
- The ID of the items are automatically generated by the server and is the maximum current ID plus one. If there are no items, the ID will be 1.
